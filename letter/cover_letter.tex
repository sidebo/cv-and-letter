LETTER WAS WRITTEN DIRECTLY IN WEB WINDOW, THIS IS WHAT I WROTE:

Dear Detectify,
I received a tip from my friend about your company and the position at Data Scientist. The work seems super interesting. I have a background in research in experimental particle physics and have worked with large datasets, data analysis, visualisation and application of statistical methods. The software I used was mostly C++ and python, and I have experience with tools such as pandas, numpy, Docker, git as well as machine learning and simulation techniques.

In the research I was part of a large collaboration at the particle physics laboratory CERN. As such, I function well and enjoy being part of a team. My colleagues would describe me as stress resilient, capable and curious with a will to understand. 

I'd love to learn more about IT security and your services. I hope you like my profile and that I can come to an interview to take things further!
