I was super excited to find your job advert in the last minute!
In this globalised world it is an immense challenge for consumers to navigate the market.
By unravelling supply chains in the Trase project you are helping to make trade more sustainable; this is a fantastic effort.
My goal is to find a workplace in which I can do what I like and am good that, but somewhere else than a regular for-profit company.
You seem to offer just that and even more–something contributing to a sustainable world. 
Honestly, I think this is my dream job.

I recently graduated from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm where I did research as part of a large international collaboration based at the particle physics laboratory CERN outside Geneva.
%Part of a group of about 25 people we carried out a measurement of the newly discovered Higgs particle, by producing such particles in the proton collisions made by the Large Hadron Collider.
My main project concerned a measurement of one of nature's elementary particles, and largely circled around analysing the large dataset of proton collisions. % and solving problems arising in the process of understanding the data.
%The research is largely based on analysing ATLAS' large dataset and solving problems arising in the process of understanding the data.
In this work I have a developed a strong analytical skill set and a creative mind. 
For two years I led the effort to estimate one particular source of contamination of the data, the estimation of which was crucial to reach publication. 
Advanced statistical methods are used to extract the most out of the data.
%However, I am mostly glad for the {\it statistical thinking} or attitude I feel I have developed--in my opinion, understanding data relies on having the right mindset, more so than being able to apply a series of methods from a recipe.
%This way of thinking is useful in all situations in which one deals with data.

I have strong skills in Python and am familiar with multivariate and machine learning techniques.
I am always eager to learn new things, which has often been the case in an environment where it is not obvious which solution is the best.
For example, I learned Docker when given the job to develop a laboration exercise for teaching purposes. 
I realised such a solution would be a neat way to eliminate the need for software installation on the student side.

During my engineering studies, my interest for the field of sustainability grew.
I added a few such courses into my otherwise physics packed degree, but those were probably my favourite. 
Working with the Trase project at SEI could therefore lie exactly in line with my personal drives as well as my skill set.
I hope I with this letter have convinced you that I am worth considering, and that I will hear from you shortly!
